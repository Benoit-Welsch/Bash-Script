# Auto-dl-playlist

A simple script to download video from a playlist.

# How it works

The script reads a file that contains a list of playlists and downloads all the videos from them. <br>
Then, the script saves the id of all the downloaded videos in a file to avoid re-downloading the videos several times.

# Dependency

- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/)
- [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
- [column](https://command-not-found.com/column) (not installed by default on alpine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

# Info

- Download file in the highest quality possible (.mp4)
- Don't support empty line in the playlist file. (So be sure to remove any empty line or the script will fail)
- All log are written in a log folder inside the output folder.
- Use crontab to automate the download
